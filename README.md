## Advanced Software Engineering Pre-Test

Thanks for your interest in Advanced Software Engineering! We’ve prepared some material to see if you are ready to take the class without the pre-requisite. 

There are a couple of tests on basic knowledge of Ruby and object oriented programming that you'll need to pass in order to be eligible for the advanced course.

Please do not sign up for the course before you have reviewed the material here and passed the tests. We cover a lot of ground in the Intro class and we want to make sure that you are prepared to have a good experience with the advanced class.

Please submit a pull request in Github when you have completed the assessments (instructions are provided in the assessment) and send an email to vanessa@flatironschool.com to let us know when you are done. We will review your code to confirm that you’ve passed the tests and get back to you as soon as we can. 

### Resources

If you don't have experience with Ruby familiarize yourself with the language by playing through the Codecademy course: http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby

Make sure you are comfortable using the terminal and basic command line navigation.
