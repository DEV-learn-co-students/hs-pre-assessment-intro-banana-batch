## Advanced Software Engineering Pre-Test

Thanks for your interest in Advanced Software Engineering! We’ve prepared some material to see if you are ready to take the class without the pre-requisite.

There are a couple of tests on basic knowledge of Ruby and object oriented programming that you'll need to pass in order to be eligible for the advanced course.

Please do not sign up for the course before you have reviewed the material here and passed the tests. We cover a lot of ground in the Intro class and we want to make sure that you are prepared to have a good experience with the advanced class.

Please submit a pull request in Github when you have completed the assessments (instructions are provided in the assessment) and send an email to daniel@flatironschool.com to let us know that you are done. We will review your code to confirm that you’ve passed the tests and get back to you as soon as we can.

### Resources

+ If you don't have experience with Ruby familiarize yourself with the language by playing through the [Codecademy Ruby course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby).

+ Make sure you are comfortable using the terminal and basic command line navigation.
  * Here is a [video tutorial](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard/command-line-basics.mp4) from Avi, the Dean of The Flatiron School.
  * We've also provided a text tutorial in the Resources section that you can access from the left navigation bar.

+ You'll need to fork and clone the Ruby assessments before you can work through them. We've provided instructions in the Resources section.

+ When you are ready, go to the Assessments section, fork and clone the Ruby labs from Github and work through the tests.
  * Once you have the tests passing, submit pull requests so we can check out your work. We've provided instructions on creating pull requests in the Ruby Basics Pre-Test.
